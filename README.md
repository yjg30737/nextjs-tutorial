* Sidebar
* Make sample articles list
* Go to the top button
* Logo design
* Search feature (algolia or another version)
### Maybe later
* using react-grid-layout (for customizing layout)
* using react-beautiful-dnd (for enhancing user experience of data list management)
* using formik (arguably the most common way to make form)
